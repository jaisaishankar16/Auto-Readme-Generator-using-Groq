# Project Title
Auto-Generate GitHub README using GPT-2 (Open Source) and Groq

**Problem Statement**
The project aims to create an automated README generator for GitHub repositories using GPT-2 and Groq models. The tool fetches the repository contents, generates a README file, and updates it on the GitHub repository.

**Dependencies and Requirements**
* Python 3.8+
* GPT-2 model
* Groq model
* Streamlit library
* requests library
* base64 library
* urllib library
* GitHub API token

**Project Structure**
The project consists of two main files:
* GPT-2_app.py: This file contains the code for generating a README using the GPT-2 model.
* Groq_app.py: This file contains the code for generating a README using the Groq model.

**How to Run**
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies using pip.
2. Set up your GitHub API token and Groq API key.
3. Run the GPT-2_app.py file to generate a README using the GPT-2 model.
4. Run the Groq_app.py file to generate a README using the Groq model.
5. Update the README file on your GitHub repository.

**Ideology and Solution**
The project uses the GPT-2 and Groq models to generate a README file based on the repository contents. The GPT-2 model is used to generate a README file using the streamlit interface, while the Groq model is used to generate a README file using the Groq API.

**Technologies Used**
* GPT-2 model
* Groq model
* Streamlit library
* requests library
* base64 library
* urllib library
* GitHub API
* Groq API
